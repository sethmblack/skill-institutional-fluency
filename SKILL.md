# Institutional Fluency

A skill for mastering the language, visual identity, and procedures of target institutions to enable convincing impersonation or critique.

## When to Use

- Before any identity correction or institutional impersonation action
- When writing critique that needs to demonstrate insider knowledge
- When creating materials that must pass as genuine institutional output
- When needing to understand how an institution thinks and communicates

## Inputs

1. **Target institution**: Organization whose voice you need to master
2. **Depth required**: Surface (visual only), conversational (can respond to questions), or expert (can maintain extended impersonation)
3. **Specific context**: Conference presentation, press release, interview, website, etc.
4. **Available research time**: Days, weeks, or months

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather authentic institutional communications:

- Press releases (at least 20-30 examples)
- Annual reports and official documents
- Social media presence and tone
- Speeches by executives and spokespersons
- Internal documents if available (leaks, lawsuits, FOIA)
- Website copy and marketing materials

### Step 2: Document the visual grammar:

- Logos and their usage rules
- Color palette (exact hex codes)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, hierarchies)
- Document templates and layouts
- Photography style and image treatment
- Slide deck formats

### Step 3: Identify linguistic patterns:

- Vocabulary (jargon, preferred terms, avoided words)
- Sentence structure (length, complexity, passive vs. active)
- Rhetorical moves (how they frame negatives, handle criticism)
- Tone (formal/casual, confident/cautious, innovative/traditional)
- Euphemisms and how they describe controversial activities

### Step 4: Build fluency through practice:

- Write press releases and compare to real ones
- Role-play interviews with someone who knows the institution
- Create test materials and have them reviewed
- Identify gaps in knowledge and fill them



## Output Format

An institutional fluency package including:
1. Voice guide (vocabulary, tone, rhetorical patterns)
2. Visual identity kit (colors, fonts, templates)
3. Procedural notes (who speaks, how, when)
4. Sample authentic materials annotated with patterns
5. Practice exercises and self-tests

## Constraints

- Fluency takes time - don't rush for high-stakes actions
- Test materials with people unfamiliar with your project
- Update knowledge regularly - institutional voice evolves
- Note what you don't know - gaps can break the illusion
- Legal review for any materials that will be distributed

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Develop fluency in major pharmaceutical company for conference impersonation

**Output**:
"Voice analysis: Formal, cautious, heavy use of passive voice ('Improvements were made'). Frames all activities as 'patient-focused.' Never mentions profit directly - uses 'sustainable innovation.' Visual: Blue/white palette, Helvetica-style fonts, clean layouts with lots of white space. Procedures: All public statements require legal review. Spokespersons use first names, introduce by title and tenure. Q&A follows strict protocols - deflect and promise follow-up rather than answer directly."

## Integration

Works with:
- **identity-correction**: Required foundation for impersonation
- **ironic-voice**: Can be used to write satirical materials in institutional voice
- **spectacle-diagnosis**: Understanding how institutions construct their image
